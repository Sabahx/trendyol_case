## 📊 Project Overview

Comprehensive analysis of Arabic translation quality for Trendyol's e-commerce platform, revealing a **60.4% false positive rate** in automated quality detection.

**Core Finding:** This is not a translation quality problem—it's an evaluation framework problem.

### Quick Stats
- **17,898 translations** analyzed across 11 languages
- **1,600 Arabic entries** deep-dive analysis
- **436 manual reviews** (27.3% sample = 3x industry standard)
- **84 documented patterns** with full traceability
- **95% statistical confidence** (±4.5% margin of error)
- **$150-200K investment** → **$215K annual savings**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

### Critical Findings
1. **60.4% False Positive Rate**
   - System flags 244 translations as errors
   - Only 66 are actual errors (27%)
   - 178 are FALSE POSITIVES (73%)
   - **$90K wasted annually** on reviewing acceptable translations

2. **Missing Arabic Framework**
   - 0 out of 10 essential Arabic NLP components
   - No standardized evaluation guidelines
   - 86.4% of errors lack documentation

3. **Evaluation Chaos**
   - Same translation practices get opposite ratings
   - Reviewers use personal judgment (no standards)
   - Brands like "Nike" flagged as errors

---
